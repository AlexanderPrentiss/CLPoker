# Command Line Poker
## Clp is a Graphical Command Line Poker Game Against the Computer
This is a project written entrirely in c as a fun command line game that allows you get a few hands of poker in between pull requests. There are command line graphics for displaying the state of the table, and imaginary $ to fret over. But what would poker be all by yourself. There is also a computer opponent that uses probability to bet wisely. Give it a try!
